Executive FinOps dashboard for cost visibility, anomaly detection, and governance in data platforms.
# FinOps Cost Governance Dashboard

## Overview

The **FinOps Cost Governance Dashboard** is an executive-level visibility and accountability tool designed for modern **data platforms and SaaS analytics environments**.

It provides:

* Clear **cost distribution by client and environment**
* Detection of **high-risk cost anomalies**
* Governance insights for **untagged or inefficient workloads**
* Decision-ready KPIs for **leadership and platform owners**

This project demonstrates how **FinOps principles** can be operationalized through lightweight dashboards, telemetry modeling, and governance metrics.

---

## Business Problem

Data platforms frequently face:

* Rapidly growing **compute and storage costs**
* Lack of **ownership tagging and accountability**
* Long-running or failed jobs wasting spend
* Limited **executive-level visibility** into cost drivers

Without structured FinOps governance, organizations struggle to balance **innovation speed** with **financial control**.

---

## Solution Approach

This repository provides a **prototype executive dashboard** that:

* Aggregates cost telemetry into **decision-focused KPIs**
* Highlights **top cost drivers and inefficiencies**
* Surfaces **governance gaps** such as untagged assets
* Enables **prioritized optimization actions**

The implementation uses **mock telemetry data** to demonstrate the product concept while remaining safe for public sharing.

## Key Features

### Executive KPI Scorecard

* Total platform spend (7-day window)
* Active cost risk indicator
* Untagged asset exposure
* Long-running workload detection
* Failure cost impact

### Cost Distribution Insights

* Spend by **client**
* Spend by **environment**
* Daily cost trend visualization

### Anomaly & Governance Detection

* Jobs exceeding duration thresholds
* High-cost / low-efficiency workloads
* Storage growth beyond safe limits
* Missing ownership or component tags

## Repository Structure

```
dashboard/        → Interactive HTML prototype
data/             → Sample telemetry dataset
docs/             → KPI definitions and architecture notes
images/           → Screenshots and diagrams
```

---

## Running the Dashboard

1. Clone the repository
2. Open:

```
dashboard/index.html
```

in any modern browser.

No installation required.

---

## Example Use Cases

* Executive **weekly FinOps review**
* Platform **cost accountability governance**
* Identification of **optimization priorities**
* Demonstration of **FinOps maturity roadmap**

---

## Architecture Concept

```
Telemetry Sources → Cost Modeling → KPI Aggregation → Executive Dashboard → Governance Actions
```

Future production implementations may integrate:

* Databricks system tables
* Cloud billing exports
* Tag governance services
* Automated optimization workflows

---

## Roadmap

* [ ] Add real telemetry connectors (Databricks / cloud billing)
* [ ] Implement anomaly detection logic
* [ ] Introduce role-based governance views
* [ ] Add cost optimization recommendation engine
* [ ] Deploy hosted dashboard demo
